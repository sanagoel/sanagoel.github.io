     <h4>Describing the Data</h4>
     <P>
        <em style="color: rgb(4, 4, 4); font-weight: bolder;">Name: </em> This is a Categorical text variable as the name of the video game is a label which can be used to catagorize but not for any arithmatics. <br>
        <em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bolder;">Platform: </em> This is a Categorical nominal variable as platforms are lables but do not have any inherent order but games can be grouped based on platform. <br>

     <h4>Q1. Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h4>
    <div id="chart1"></div>
        <p><em style="color: rgb(4, 4, 4); font-weight: bolder;">Q1. Reflection:</em> <br>
        I notice trends in the data that show how action, shooter and sports games dominate the charts. it is also interesting to notice that PS2, X360, PS3, WII, DS and PS have a much highter number of sales than all the other platforms adn clearly dominate the video games markets.</p>

    <h4>Q2. Global Sales over time by Genre and Platform</h4>
    <div id="chart2"></div>
            <p><em style="color: rgb(4, 4, 4); font-weight: bolder;">Q2. Reflection:</em> <br> 
                In these visualizations I see how the PS2, PS3, PS4 hav been some of the biggest gaming platforms seen till date with their sales reaching highs that only the Wii and X360 have come close to matching. 
                For the Genres we see that actions games have has the longest streak of high sales making them the most popular over the years, followed by sports. 
                </p>

    <h4>Q3. Regional Sales Vs. Platform</h4>
    <div id="chart3"></div>
                <p><em style="color: rgb(4, 4, 4); font-weight: bolder;">Q3. Reflection:</em> <br>
                    We see that the Play Stations, wii adn X360 dominate sales in both North America and Europe, however, in japan and other places while still popular they are more comparable to other platform sales. 
                    North America also has the highest sales for the Playstations, DS, wii and X360 compared to any other regions. 
                    </p>

    <h4>Q4. Regional Genre Preferences</h4>
    <div id="chart4"></div>
        <p><em style="color: rgb(4, 4, 4); font-weight: bolder;">Q4. Reflection:</em> <br> 
                Here we see that nNorth America dominates in Action, shooter, sports and platform games disproportionately whereas Japan has higher sales in role playing games adn while these are similar to North America 
                it is a lot higher than their share in other Genres.
